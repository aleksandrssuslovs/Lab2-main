Lab Variant 3. Python Calorie Counter
The calorie counter app is a great way to keep track of all the calories you are burning every day. The user can add all the food they are eating and the app will count the calories. You can further add a function for users to add their daily workout sessions, running and jogging to calculate how much calories they have burned.
